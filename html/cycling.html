                A hobby is nothing but a gentle and pleasant occupation designed to take the tired brain off the burden of the main task. 
                It is not one’s main business or occupation; it is an alternative mental occupation. I believe that every person should have 
                a hobby because, without a favorite occupation, it’s just boring to live. Hobby helps to develop a person, because, while 
                doing what he likes, a person always strives to learn something new about his favorite occupation, often communicates with
                other people who are addicted to the same thing. Everyone has a favorite hobby. I have also a favorite hobby. My favorite 
                hobby is cycling. It is my favorite sports to do whenever I have free time.  It's good for our health, if we also can enjoy 
                the scenery and feel the natural winds. You have to find the perfect place to cycling harmoniously. The benefits of cycling 
                are numerous:  it’s a heart health hobby that enhances brain activity and reduces carbon gas release. It’s also a fun outdoor 
                activity.  Cycling is easier on the joints than running and can be enjoyed all seasons, unlike swimming. All-in-all cycling 
                is a beneficial physical activity and hobby.
