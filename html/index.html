            <p>
                Hobby is a regular activity that is done for enjoyment. A list of hobbies is lengthy and always changing as interests and 
                fashions change. Hobbies can bring in enthusiasm and a pleasure that enriches life. If you haven’t found the right hobby, 
                then keep looking. The “pursuit of happiness” is half the fun. There are several different types of hobbies to help you narrow 
                down what you’re interested in doing with your spare time. 
                Hobbyists may be identified under three sub-categories: casual leisure which is intrinsically rewarding, short-lived, 
                pleasurable activity requiring little or no preparation, serious leisure which is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, 
                hobbyist, or volunteer that is substantial, rewarding and results in a sense of accomplishment, and finally project-based 
                leisure which is a short-term, often one-off, project that is rewarding.
